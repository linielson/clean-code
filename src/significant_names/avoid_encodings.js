// We have enough encodings to deal with without adding more to our burden. Encoding
// type or scope information into names simply adds an extra burden of deciphering. It
// hardly seems reasonable to require each new employee to learn yet another encoding “language”
// in addition to learning the (usually considerable) body of code that they’ll be working
// in. It is an unnecessary mental burden when trying to solve a problem. Encoded names
// are seldom pronounceable and are easy to mis-type.
