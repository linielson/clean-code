  Remember that the people who read your code will be programmers. So go ahead and use
computer science (CS) terms, algorithm names, pattern names, math terms, and so forth.
It is not wise to draw every name from the problem domain because we donâ€™t want our
coworkers to have to run back and forth to the customer asking what every name means
when they already know the concept by a different name.
  The name AccountVisitor means a great deal to a programmer who is familiar with
the VISITOR pattern. What programmer would not know what a JobQueue was? There are
lots of very technical things that programmers have to do. Choosing technical names for
those things is usually the most appropriate course.
