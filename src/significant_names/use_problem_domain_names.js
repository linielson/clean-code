/*
  When there is no “programmer-eese” for what you’re doing, use the name from the problem
domain. At least the programmer who maintains your code can ask a domain expert
what it means.
  Separating solution and problem domain concepts is part of the job of a good programmer
and designer. The code that has more to do with problem domain concepts
should have names drawn from the problem domain.
